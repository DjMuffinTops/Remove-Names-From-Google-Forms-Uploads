### Paste the contents of `RemoveNamesFromGoogleFormsUploads.js` into the script. 
You will need to replace the `folderId` with the folder you'd like the script to run on. You can get the folder id in the url to your google drive folder, its the stuff after `/folders/` in the url.

- `Preview Rename Functions` will go through the contents of the given folder and record what it would rename the files too onto the spreadsheet.

- `Rename Functions` will do the same but actually rename the files.

- Both of these have a `Recursively` function which means it will also search through any sub folders of the given folder.

### These are the headers for what the functions will produce, you may want to add these yourself. All results will go below!
